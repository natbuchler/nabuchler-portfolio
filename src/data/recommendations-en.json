    "text": "Having worked with Natasha not only made me a better leader, manager, and designer, but also a better person. We all knew she would bring much-needed change and energy to our team, but we underestimated just how much we would learn from her. Her impact was immediate. Her poise and energy are infectious. Her attention to detail, customer-first mindset, and exceptional craft are all impressive. From her human-centered approach to leadership, to her unparalleled ability to manage demanding stakeholders and aggressive timelines, Natasha is a breath of fresh air, and change agent that any organization would be lucky to have. What truly sets Natasha apart, however, is how deeply she cares, for the individuals on her team, their professional and personal growth, and for delivering products that reflect that same level of care. She is a rare combination of talent, empathy, and executional excellence.",

Her empathy, openness, and ability to balance guidance with freedom created an environment where we could thrive both professionally and personally. I'm very grateful to have had the chance to learn from her leadership.",
